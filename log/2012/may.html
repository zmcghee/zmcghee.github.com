<font size=+1 face=palatino color=purple>Carnage (2011, Roman Polanski): <font color=red>C</font></font><p>

Once again I find myself in <a href="http://www.panix.com/~dangelo/Nov11.html#carn.html">near-complete agreement with md'a</a>, right down to the extraordinarily odd device of having Waltz and Winslet always on the verge of leaving when we know they're not going anywhere (and then not even giving us the satisfaction of ever being able to see them leave, since the movie ends before things are resolved). Too cute by half, in other words. Here four of the best actors working in movies today lower themselves in service of one of the worst, most cynical, arrogant, and least insightful scripts (from Reza's play, <em>God of Carnage</em>) to emerge in years. Tough to get through even at a mere 80 minutes, I only stuck around because (1) it's Polanski and it wasn't completely unwatchable and (2) these actors would be worth watching alongside Kirk Cameron in an installment of the <em>Left Behind</em> series. That said, unless you loved the play or already have the movie at home from Netflix or whatever, I'd advise you to pass.

<font size=+1 face=palatino color=purple>Rashomon (1950, Akira Kurosawa): <font color=red>B+</font></font><p>

Not sure I'm quite on the right wavelength to ever be all &iexcl;KUROSAWA ZOMGWTFBBQ! like some folks, but certainly this (only my second Kurosawa) has gone a long way to assuage my fears that everyone of the legendary director's titles was going to be as much of a slog as <em>Seven Samurai</em>. (I know, I know, this is sacrilege. It's either the <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/poll/directors.html">9th-</a> or <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/poll/critics-long.html">11th-greatest</a> film ever made. I'll turn in my cinephile card now. I, uh, did only see it on Blu-ray... Please put down that sword...) The thing is, though I recognize greatness in both films, there's what I can only describe as an historical distance that keeps me at arms length. <em>Rashomon</em> is also arguably more overlong than <em>Seven Samurai</em>, even at a mere 88 minutes vs. the latter's 207 (in that it feels it should be wrapping up at least a good 10-15 minutes before it actually does; apparently Kurosawa only lengthened his script in response to investor concern and/or confusion), but overall I found it much more engaging. Minor qualms: The film's ambiguous conclusion has a requisite hopefulness is both predictable and undermines that which has preceded it; and the decision to let the audience play the role of interrogator is a daring and provocative one, but it also results in a lot of silly <i>What's that?</i>-ing (e.g. "What? Oh her dagger? I hadn't thought about it," in response to absolutely no one). What is most compelling in <em>Rashomon</em> is its core story illustrating the nature of subjectivity &mdash; a single event told from differing perspectives. &mdash; and here <em>Rashomon</em> is not only groundbreaking but nearly unparalleled in its effect. Furthermore, it's easy to see why Mifune was Kurosawa's favorite actor, and why they collaborated so frequently: Mifune brings a commitment, intensity and dynamism to his role here that I've rarely seen in the movies. Ebert gets at <em>Rashomon</em>'s lasting influence and its central philosophy which brings into question cinema itself (Kurosawa probably most directly alludes to this when the commoner says, "I don't care if it's a lie, as long as it's entertaining"): "Film cameras are admirably literal, and faithfully record everything they are pointed at. Because they are usually pointed at real things, we usually think we can believe what we see. The message of <em>Rashomon</em> is that we should suspect even what we think we have seen."

<font size=+1 face=palatino color=purple>The Turin Horse (2011, B&#xE9;la Tarr): <font color=red>C+</font></font><p>

First shot is hauntingly beautiful and establishes a captivating rhythm that the rest of the movie fails to sustain. It begins in the <em>Jeanne Dielman</em>-esque mode of showing the driver and his daughter complete everyday repetitive tasks meant to illustrate that when we're reduced to our mere usefulness is when we're most dehumanized. After watching them boil potatoes and eat them for the second or third time, I thought, "Gee, two and a half hours is kind of a long time to hammer home a single idea, no matter how profound." You can't win with me though, I guess, because when it became apparent that Tarr was also getting at his characters' resistance to change by having outside forces attempt to impact them on each of the six days but (spoiler) leaving them essentially unchanged, I couldn't help but think it diluted the impact of his central thesis. (For a movie ostensibly dedicated to the oppressive effect of the mundane, each of these days is actually quite eventful.) What I found most difficult to stomach, however, was the hypocrisy of Tarr enslaving a horse for the purposes of a film that goes to great lengths to encourage us to elevate and acknowledge all our fellow living creatures as more than just props or tools. Had he thought outside the box and had a wooden horse, puppet, or even an actor stand in for the horse, it could've underlined and given clarity to his ideas. As it is, in an effort to get us all thinking like Nietzsche, Tarr has become the driver.

<font size=+1 face=palatino color=purple>\Mad Max 2\ (1981, George Miller): <font color=red>B</font></font><p>

Although I welcome modern movies like <em>The Avengers</em> that feature witty dialogue and come bearing an author's distinct point of view, imagine if, say, <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</em> could lose its expository, incoherent babbling and instead dedicate itself only to its visually spectacular final hour. Miller puts on no airs. He constructs enough of a plot to support genuinely terrific action sequences and his stylish vision of the future that marries BDSM with a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape. (Clearly Hollywood should've kept him working on a shoestring, because after this he quickly turns overindulgent.) Kael identifies my only significant qualm, aside from the throwaway opening ("<em>Previously on </em>Mad Max..."), when she writes that Miller consciously turns his hero into an icon: "That's enough to squeeze the juice out of any actor, and Max seems bland and apathetic." <em>Mad Max 2</em>, as the version we saw was simply titled, holds its hero in such high regard as to make him abstract; Gibson is a big empty hole at the center of an otherwise spare and riveting diversion. Although it's not transcendent filmmaking, it's enough.

<font size=+1 face=palatino color=purple>Dark Shadows (2012, Tim Burton): 
<font color=red>C</font></font><p>

Ultra-lite entertainment is perfectly cast (though many cast members are underutilized), but coasts on fish-out-of-water gags and amiable atmosphere. It makes for an easy couple of hours, but offers little creativity and absolutely no wit. Besides, it's hard to get excited about what is essentially a lame version of a movie Barry frickin' Sonnenfeld has already made... 20 years ago... <em>twice</em>! (<em>The Addams Family</em> and <em>Addams Family Values</em> are both exponentially smarter, funnier, and more memorable efforts.) Meh.

<font size=+1 face=palatino color=purple>/Dark City/ (1998, Alex Proyas): <font color=red>B</font></font><p>

Well, at least I get it now. Even if I don't quite share Ebert's level of enthusiasm for Proyas's highly inventive, visually spectacular, now cult classic, scifi flick, this viewing much improves upon the hazy memory I have of watching it on DVD circa '99. Teenage me came away from <em>Dark City</em> essentially nonplussed; seeing it this (only my second) time, on the big screen, in 35mm, I spent the first two or three reels perpetually in awe. Alas, aside from being overly expository (something upon which the director's cut, which I'm now eager to finally see, reportedly improves), Proyas and his fellow screenwriters can't quite seem to settle upon the right narrative framework to explore his (admittedly genius) conceit: First it's a neo-noir, then it's an Oz-like search for the man behind the curtain, it's never quite a romance, and finally it simply explodes abruptly into a -- somewhat silly looking, I might add ("Hmm, how can we <em>visualize</em> telekinesis?") -- special effects battle for which the stakes should be incredibly high, but that begins and ends so suddenly that it feels exactly like the hackneyed deus ex machina that it is. One other, much more minor, caveat -- one that I'd be less inclined to mention if the story were better constructed -- is that I don't get the sense that Proyas is purposefully getting at any particularly heady or existential ideas; it's more as if he comes upon them by accident, which only adds to the movie's dramatic incoherence. Still, studio effects movies as daring and peculiar as this one aren't exactly commonplace, and I'd happily sit through any number of <em>Crow</em> sequels and portentous Will Smith vehicles if it meant I was guaranteed at some point in his career Proyas would deliver another movie half as interesting as this one.

<font size=+1 face=palatino color=purple>Mad Max 2 (1981, George Miller): <font color=red>W/O</font></font><p>

Alamo Drafthouse cooked up an awesome Rolling Roadshow event to celebrate the 30th anniversary of <em>Mad Max 2</em>, featuring a beautiful 35mm print of the Australian cut of the film, but shown at Thunderhill Raceway in Kyle, Texas. The event kicked off with a "LIVE Thermonuclear Flaming Death Race!: 4 Cars on an Anti-Human, Fire-Blasting Rampage of Utter Destruction!" which did not disappoint. Then there was live music before the show performed by a band formed specifically (and only) for the occasion. It was a ton of fun, and a great atmosphere, but once the movie started it quickly became apparent to me that -- though memorable -- this wasn't exactly the ideal way to see this movie for the first time, with our view obstructed by the raceway's safety fence, uncomfortable bench seating, and folks talking and using their phones (it's just a different environment from the strict Drafthouse culture, and expectedly so). If we'd seen <em>The Road Warrior</em> a time or two before, we definitely could've (and would've) stayed and enjoyed ourselves, but instead we bailed before the first reel had even finished unspooling. We'll see the movie proper Sunday night at the Ritz instead.

<font size=+1 face=palatino color=purple>Sleepless Night (2011, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric Jardin): <font color=red>C-</font></font><p>

What begins merely as a mediocre after-hours thriller in the corrupt cop / drug heist gone bad / kidnapping arena (which by now, I'd argue, needs its own much snappier genre name since I feel pretty confident I've seen all four of these ingredients featured prominently in the plots of at least 32 other movies, of which Wayner Kramer's little-seen <em>Running Scared</em> is the best in recent years) quickly devolves from mere boilerplate to annoyingly inept. Jardin substitutes a high-tempo soundtrack and haphazard visual style for genuine intensity, which he seems unable to achieve within the confines of his single -- but apparently boundless? -- location. Ostensibly a race-against-the-clock-type picture, the increasingly contrived machinations of <em>Sleepless Night</em>'s plot make a movie that's clearly desperate to burst off the screen with energy feel utterly stagnant. (The stringer reviewing it for the <em>Voice</em> called it "ingeniously simple yet deceptively intricate," of which it is neither.) One chase scene seems to span a single room before Vincent's pursuers simply give up, apparently foiled by his cunning ability to dart across 10 or 15 feet. Later they sit at the bar lamenting the exhausting task they've had of chasing him around all night when, I'm really quite sure, they hadn't had another encounter with him up to that point. When Vincent's kidnapped son Thomas manages to get his (previously somewhat absent) father on the phone, Vincent tells Thomas he's all that matters now. The movie pauses to force Vincent to recognize how his emotional distance has wounded his son, as Thomas asks: "Why couldn't you tell me that before?" Really, Thomas? You want to have that discussion now? YOU ARE FUCKING KIDNAPPED! I was prepared to laud the ambiguity of Vincent's "confession" to Vignali halfway through the film, but my hopes were dashed: Not only do we receive a definitive motive for Vincent's "corruption," but said motive retroactively renders every decision he's made throughout the movie completely implausible, as well as undoing the little goodwill Jardin and his co-writers had earned from me by putting their movie on the shoulders of a largely unsympathetic protagonist. And in spite of the havoc Vincent and the folks after him have wreaked on this single establishment, no one -- not even the kitchen staff, who are not just repeatedly hounded but assualted by Vincent -- calls for more cops. Though it's overlong even at 98 minutes, its arthouse ending only cemented my frustration: I don't require a neat, unambiguous resolution of every narrative, I only ask that it reach a natural dramatic conclusion. <em>Sleepless Night</em> either goes on longer than it should or ends too suddenly; its final frames seem motivated by pretense rather than plot or poetry. Tomer Sisley is appropriately harried as Vincent, but only the underutilized Julien Boisselier seems to have the pulse this movie really needed.
